# Yellow Hat Travels(YHT) & Jehova's Witness Travels(JWT)

### About YHT
Yellow Hat Travels is a boutique travel planning company that focuses on personalized and uniquely curated travel experiences. Our service include private holidays which are curated specifically for your interests, needs and budget. We cater for solo travelers, couples and groups.

What we are not is your typical travel agency which often puts people in one box. We understand that people are different and we thus take time to listen and create a tailor-made holiday for you. Basically – your whole vacation will be built around you.

Additionally, we are a Tour Operator company which specializes in Group Tours which are hosted for your comfort. We are passionate about opening new opportunities for those who have always dreamed of travelling but thought it is not reachable, for those who have been disappointed a hundred times by family or friends who back down on trips. We empower women, especially all those who previously could never dream that seeing the world was within their reach – doing all this without breaking a bank.

As Travel Planners and Tour Operators our job and concern is to take care of every detail of your trip, making sure that all you need to do is enjoy your vacation.
